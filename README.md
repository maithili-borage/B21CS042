12. The different states a process can be in xV6 systems are - 
- Unused: This state indicates that the process is not currently in use(process is just created or terminated).
- Embryo: The process is in the process of being created. The process is not yet initialized.
- Sleeping: The process is waiting for some event to occur(Input/Output or sleep timer).
- Runnable: A process is ready to execute but is waiting for its turn to run on the CPU.
- Running: Process is running on the CPU.
- Zombie: After the execution, process waits for the parent status to receive the exit status. This state is zombie state.
- Waiting: The process is waiting for some other event to complete(Eg. completion of child process).











14. 
The file system in XV6 is a simple implementation of a Unix-like file system. It is based on the File Allocation Table (FAT) file system and consists of several key components:
Superblock:
The superblock is a data structure that contains essential information about the file system, such as the size of the file system, the block size, the location of the root directory, and other metadata.
It is typically located at a fixed position on the disk and is read into memory during the file system's initialization.
Inodes:
Inodes (Index Nodes) are data structures that store information about individual files and directories. Each file or directory in the file system is associated with an inode.
Inode information includes file type, permissions, owner, group, size, timestamps, and pointers to data blocks.
Directory Entries:
Directory entries map names to inodes, allowing the file system to organize files into directories. Each directory is essentially a list of directory entries.
Directory entries contain the name of the file or subdirectory and the corresponding inode number.
Data Blocks:
Data blocks store the actual contents of files. For small files, data may be stored directly in the inode, while larger files use a series of data blocks.
The file system manages these data blocks, and the inode contains pointers to these blocks.
Bitmaps:
Bitmaps are used to keep track of free and allocated blocks in the file system. There are typically two bitmaps: one for free inodes and another for free data blocks.
Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a specific inode or data block, indicating whether it is in use or free.
File Descriptors (File Table):
The file descriptor table, maintained by the kernel, keeps track of open files for each process. Each entry in the table points to a file object, which contains information about the open file, including the corresponding inode and the current offset within the file.
File Allocation Table (FAT):
The FAT is used to keep track of the allocation status of data clusters on the disk. It is particularly common in FAT file systems and is used for file allocation and tracking free space.

14.System Calls:
System calls are interfaces provided by the operating system to allow user-level programs to request services from the kernel.
These calls provide a way for user-space processes to interact with the underlying operating system kernel, accessing privileged operations such as file I/O, process control, memory management, and more.
In XV6, system calls are invoked using a software interrupt. The user-level program triggers a trap into the kernel by executing an instruction like int 0x30, and the kernel then dispatches the appropriate system call handler based on the interrupt number.
Example in XV6: The fork() system call is used to create a new process. The user-level program invokes it, and the kernel responds by creating a new process.
Library Functions:
Library functions are routines provided by libraries that are linked with user-level programs. These functions are not part of the operating system itself but are bundled with the application code.
Library functions are written in user-level code and use system calls to interact with the operating system when necessary.
In XV6, the standard C library (libc) provides a set of functions that abstract away the details of system calls, making it easier for programmers to write portable and efficient code.
Example in XV6: The printf() function is part of the standard C library and is used for formatted output. It internally may use system calls like write() to output data to the console.
